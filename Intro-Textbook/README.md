Code snippets following the online material of the course 'Introduction to Earth Data Science' by the Earth Lab CU Boulder:
https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/intro-to-earth-data-science/

The course gives an introduction to data analytics in the field of earth science, focussing on how to examine and visualize data stored as common earth science data formats.
The code here is my implementation of the exercises and examples, closely following the code provided in the online textbook.
